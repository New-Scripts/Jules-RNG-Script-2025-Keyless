# Roblox Jule's RNG Script

Welcome to the official repository for **Jule's RNG Script** for Roblox! This script is designed to add randomness and fairness to in-game mechanics, perfect for game developers who want to integrate an RNG (Random Number Generator) system into their Roblox games.

## Features
- **Easy Integration**: Quickly add randomness to your game with minimal setup.
- **Customizable**: Modify the RNG range, seed values, and outputs to match your game’s needs.
- **Robust**: Tested for performance and reliability in various game scenarios.
- **Versatile**: Can be used for loot boxes, random encounters, or any gameplay mechanic needing unpredictability.
- **Lightweight**: Small footprint for optimal performance.

## Installation
To integrate Jule's RNG Script into your Roblox game, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the **JulesRNGScript** module into your Roblox project.
3. In your script, require the RNG module and configure it based on your needs.

```lua
local RNG = require(game.ServerStorage.JulesRNGScript)

-- Example usage
local randomResult = RNG:GetRandomNumber(1, 100)
print("Random result: " .. randomResult)
```

## How It Works
Jule's RNG Script leverages the **Roblox Random** class and a custom seed generator for controlled randomness. The `GetRandomNumber(min, max)` function generates random values between the specified range, offering a flexible solution for many gameplay scenarios.

## Use Cases
- **Loot Boxes**: Create random rewards based on predefined probabilities.
- **Random Events**: Trigger unpredictable events, such as rare spawns or treasure chests.
- **Game Mechanics**: Implement randomized challenges, weather conditions, or gameplay elements.
